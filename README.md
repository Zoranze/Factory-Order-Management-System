Itâ€™s a computerized system designed for a textile factory to manage orders, track stock,
and monitor costs like transport. The system includes cool features like password protection, dynamic product searches, automatic quote-to-order conversion,
and inventory alerts to avoid stock shortages.

Iâ€™ve also included a well-designed GUI, database integration, and UML diagrams to visualize how everything works.
The goal is to make order processing smoother, keep track of inventory, and help the business run more efficiently.
